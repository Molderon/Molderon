Greetings, I'm Molderon

  -> a Bit about me...
I'm the *Sci-fi/Metalhead* type-a-nerd, I find my-self quite inquisitive to the 
field of Computer Science && I support Richard Stallman's free software movement.

So mainly I Code in C/C++, Yet I'm Overthinking to dive into Python/GoLang
(seems like lot's of fun). 

If you wish to contact me 
-> Molderon18@gmail.com
