Greetings, I'm @Molderon

  I'm mainly a self-taught Programmer and I find 
my-self quite inquisitive in the fileds of: 
Back-end Development,  ML,  CyberSecurity,  Linux & 
as well tinkering arould with Embedded Systems.

  -> a Bit about me...
So mainly I Code in C/C++, Yet I'm Overthinking to dive into Python/GoLang
(seems like lot's of fun) and I wish to participate in Richard Stallman's free software movement.
I'm currently finishing an Idustrial Engineering degree with little enfices on robotics.
Also venturing on my first steps as a Software Engineer.

If you wish to contact me 
-> Molderon18@gmail.com

   (Off-topic stuff)
   
*I'm a Sci-fi/Metalhead type-a-nerd & I really love the immersive-sim genre.
(holding the Deus Ex series close to heart). 
Also I have a "hobby level" of interest in Computer Hacking \m/*
